# Learn Modern JavaScript methods by building football team cards

This is a project for learning modern JavaScript methods such as destructuring, the spread operator, and object literals.

The project is to create a webpage that displays information about a football team, including the team name, sport, year, head coach, and players. The players are displayed in a card format, with each card showing the player's name, position, number, and nickname.

The project also includes a filter feature, which allows the user to filter the players by position or nickname.
